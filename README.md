MLB.py and convolutional.py are used for training MLB and convolutional model in order to tell whether the photo is about rose or sunflower.
The models were trained by the data in train.zip, which contain two folders named rose and sunflower. Over 1500 photos of roses and sunflowers
are included. training set and validation set were divided by the code inside the 2 python files.
After generating and saving the model, predict.py can load corresponding model and identify the photo you choose.
The photo should be 64 by 64 pixels.

The accuracy of CNN model is about 0.98 and the accuracy of validation set is about 0.89.
The accuracy of MLB model is about 0.82 and the accuracy of validation set is about 0.79.

The overfitting of MLB model is lower, but its accuracy is also lower.
